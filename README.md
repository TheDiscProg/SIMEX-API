# Mangaging Complexity and Security in Software Engineering

Many modern applications suffer from complexity and security.

The complexity in software can have a negative impact on maintenance, i.e. bug fixing, and enhancement. It has been compared to a werewolf that results in "missed schedules, blown budgets and flawed products." This complexity arises mainly due to abstraction of business models and is, sometimes, futher complicated by the additional abstraction in Scala applications.

A number of data breeches have highlighted that Internet-facing application servers that connect to data source, i.e databases, are inherently unsafe.

This research paper highlights two key designs that can assist in taming the werewolf:

1. Simple Message Exchange API (Simex)
2. Simex Oriented Asynchronous Architecture (SOAA)

In addition, the research paper also details a network protocol, Simex Exchange Protocol or SEP for short, that can be used to enhance communication.
